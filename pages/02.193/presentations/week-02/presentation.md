# WaterFall Challenges

* Software development as pure production
* Knowing all required information upfront
* Time estimates are extremely hard to make
* Often entire project must be completed to fully test
* Long feedback and development cycles

# Agile Manifesto

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
Working software over comprehensive documentation  
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
Responding to change over following a plan

# Lean Development (based on the Toyota Way)(1)

* A mindset, or **way of thinking**, commitment to achieve a totally waste-free operation that’s focused on your customer’s success
* It is achieved by **simplifying and continuously improving** all processes and relationships in an environment of trust, respect and full employee involvement
* It is about people, simplicity, flow, visibility, partnerships and true value **as perceived by the customer**

# With Lean each Design (Decision) is Viewed as a Hypothesis

A hypothesis can be defined as an educated guess that then can be tested to be shown correct

# Example Hypotheses (includes outcome & assumption)

* We believe that our customers will find the “add to cart” button because it is highly visible
* We believe that our customers will be able to complete the checkout process because it is very simple

* Strategize & conceptualize
* Visualize & prototype
* Evaluate & refine

---

* Contextual inquiries
* Empathy maps
* Interviews
* Job stories
* Jobs to be Done
* Personas
* Proto-personas
* Surveys
* Task analysis
* Five Ws and one H
* The five whys
* User stories

# _What is the difference between a user goal and a task?_

---

# User Goal vs. Task

## Goals

* Things users want or need to achieve
* Tend to remain constant over time
* System independent
* Reaching a goal changes the state of the world

---

# User Goal vs. Task

## Tasks

* Must be performed to reach goals
* Tend to change over time, often due to technology
* System dependent
* May require problem solving

---

# Questions to Help Discover User Goals and Tasks

* Why would they use the system (goals)?
* What do they need to do to reach their goals (tasks)?
* What are common problems encountered?
* When would they use the system?
* Where would they be using the system?

# Activity: User Goals vs. Tasks

THINK-PAIR-SHARE  
Examples of student goals and tasks for using the GoSFU course registration system?

---

# Example Task Analysis Tools

* Task inventory (incl. frequency & importance)
* Task frequency & importance matrix
* Task sequences
* Flowcharts

---

# Task Importance & Frequency Matrix

| Task List | User Group #1 | User Group #2 | User Group #3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task #1 |  High/Frequent | High/Infrequent  | Low/Infrequent |
| Task #2 |  Never | Low/Infrequent | High/Frequent |
| Task #3 |  Low/Infrequent | Never  | High/Infrequent |
| Task #4 |  Low/Infrequent | Low/Infrequent | Low/Infrequent |

---

# Organizing an Interface by Tasks

* Important & frequent - higher visibility, fewer taps
* Important & infrequent - higher visibility, more taps
* Unimportant & frequent - lower visibility, fewer taps
* Unimportant & infrequent - lower visibility, more taps

# Strategize & Conceptualize

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/ux-toolkit-8-no-numbers.png)

---

# Strategize & Conceptualize

* Conceptual models
* Content strategy
* Journey maps
* Kano model
* Problem statement
* Product design principles
* Product Reaction Cards
* Seven stages of action
* Usability/UX goals
* Value Proposition
* Valuing UX

---

# Usability Goals - How it Works

* Learnability (first-time users)
 * The product should be easy to learn
* Efficiency (experienced users)
 * The product should be efficient to use
* Memorability (casual users)
 * The product should be easy to remember
* Error-resistance (all users)
 * The product should minimize usage errors

---

# Defining Usability Goals

* Common factors for consideration are
 * Frequency of use
 * Importance of task or need
 * Task structure (e.g. complexity, repetition)
 * Motivation/attitude
* Assign a priority to each goal (e.g. 1-3)
 * Could be specifically measured, but overall usability assessment (e.g. SUS) is usually sufficient

---

# UX Goals - How it Feels

* [Product Reaction Cards by Microsoft (2002)](http://www.microsoft.com/usability/UEPostings/ProductReactionCards.doc)
* 118 words (60% positive, 40% negative)
* Sample words
 * Appealing
 * Complex
 * Familiar
 * Hard to use
 * Organized
 * Relevant
 * Too technical
 * Valuable

---

# Defining UX Goals with Product Reaction Cards

* Select a set number of attributes (i.e. 4 to 8)
 * For each attribute, assign a priority and note reason
 * Consider visualizing results (e.g. word cloud)

# Evaluate & Refine

---

[.background-color: #FFFFFF]

![fit](images/ux-toolkit-8-no-numbers.png)

---

# Evaluate & Refine

* 5-Second test
* Cognitive walkthrough
* Heuristic review
* Usability testing (informal and formal)

---

# Measuring Usability Goals

* Learnability (first-time users)
 * Can a new user complete a task?
* Efficiency (experienced users)
 * How fast can a user complete a task?
* Memorability (casual users)
 * How easy can a repeat user recall how to complete a task?
* Error-resistance (all users)
 * How often does the software cause users to make an error?

---

# Measuring UX Goals with Product Reaction Cards

* Measuring
 * Reduce attributes to ≈ 60 to 80
 * Ask participants to select most relevant 10
 * Visualize the results (e.g. word cloud)
