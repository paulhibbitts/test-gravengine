# Course Overview

### CMPT 363

> ‚ÄúWhen software is hard to use, don‚Äôt make excuses for it. Improve it. When a user makes a mistake, don‚Äôt blame the user. Ask how the software misled them. Then fix it. The user‚Äôs time is more valuable than ours. Respect it. Good UI design is humble.‚Äù
‚Äî Jono DiCarlo

##### _Please take a seat in the front half of the theater, thank you!_

# üö®Reasons To Avoid This Courseüö®

* Weekly readings, along with a quiz, are required
* Frequent in-class individual and group exercises
* Group assignment(s) are mandatory
* Assignments will require a substantial amount of effort
* Satisfactory peer reviews may be a requirement to group assignments
* Good communication _and_ writing skills are critical  
* It is a design course, where assessments will often be determined on subjective opinion (primarily mine)
* I expect your designs to be more than just usable (also useful and desirable)
* Instructor feedback and critique sessions
* Getting A‚Äôs in other computer science courses has little relevance in this course
* Final exam (40%), more on that later!

# Reasons Why You Might Want To Stick Around

* A ~~good~~ great UX is now a software industry expectation
* Poorly designed interfaces cost money, require additional support, and waste people‚Äôs valuable time
* A basic understanding of user experience design processes and techniques will be helpful when working in the software industry
* You will experience how to work on design challenges
within teams
* The user-centered design process and techniques that you will learn can be applied to many other domains
* You have the opportunity to learn from an experienced UX practitioner, open source author, and educator ([ca.linkedin.com/in/paulhibbitts/](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/paulhibbitts/))

# Weekly Review Quizzes

The creation of course assessment questions is a valuable learning exercise for students, as it moves beyond the simple recollection of facts to a deeper analysis of course material. This approach also increases student involvement with their final exam experience.
