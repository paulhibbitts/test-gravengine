# False Mobile Assumptions

* Being mobile means being in a rush
* Mobile searches are mostly done on-the-go
* Mobile users are ok with having less
* Context is king (instead think about intent)

# _So, we need to think more about multi-device, and not just mobile_

# Mobile First

* Mobile First, as defined by Luke Wroblewski in 2009
* Adoption (larger audience for mobile)
* Focus (content and functionality constraints)
* Technologies (touch, geolocation, etc.)

# Mobile First, To Me

* When  the element of mobility is a core value proposition
* Even given that, I prefer the battle cry of Experience First (HT @kevinmpowell) these days... why?
 * Mobile usage (i.e. “on the go”) is context guessing at best
 * No longer a singular mobile device, but a family of devices
 * Since mobile to me is device independent – I define it as  “being close at hand” or “being available”
 * People deserve content/function parity everywhere
 * The best experience should always be leveraged, not constrained, by device attributes

# Multi-device Experience Goals

* Conceptual and visual consistency
* Content and functionality parity
* Seamless task transferability
* Think ecosystem, not isolated devices
* Optimize physical interactions on every device

# Google Mobile Design Principles

* Home page and site navigation (1 of 5 categories)
 * Keep calls to action front and center
 * Keep menus short and sweet
 * Make it easy to get back to the home page
 * Don’t let promotions steal the show

# Essential Touch Interaction Design Guidelines

* Touch Target Size
* Placement of Controls
* Behavior (i.e. no hovers)
* User Effort
* Gestures (i.e. standard and non-standard)

# Mobile and Multi-device Design

### Responsive Web Design (RWD)

---

![fit](https://www.paulolyslager.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/responsive_design.png)

---

# Responsive Web Design (RWD)

* Content/interface universal for all devices
* One source of content, presented differently
* Key elements
 * CSS media queries
 * Fluid grid layouts
 * Flexible images and media

---

![fit](https://viljamis.com/img/blog/workflow-9c647694.png)

---

# Intrinsic Web Design (a future successor to RWD?)

Use of Flexbox, Grid, and Box alignment for much more fine-grained control of placement

---

# Intrinsic Web Design

* Fluid & fixed
* Stages of squishiness
* Rows & columms
* Nested contexts
* Ways expand & contract
* Media queries,as needed

# My RWD Design Process

* Discover (always lots to learn...)
* List and prioritize the content (nothing fancy)
* Development
 * Sketch (content placeholders, mostly for breakpoints)
 * Wireframe (a teeny bit really, sometimes none)
 * Visual Design (rough layout colour comps, maybe)
 * Prototype (a whole lot, and then some more!)
 * Test (rinse and repeat as needed)
* Deliver

# Responsive Web Design Sketch Sheets

# Content Inventories

* A standard IA technique - even more essential for RWD
* Inventory a first step, but prioritization is the key
* Plays a key role when deciding upon RWD breakpoints

---

# Typical Content Inventory Structure

* Content
* Type
* Location
* Meta-data
* Owner
* Last updated
* Comments

---

# RWD Content Inventory Adjustments

* Content
* _Priority_
* Type
* _Size (characters, image dpi/dimensions, etc.)_
* Location
* Meta-data
* Content owner
* Last updated
* Comments

---

# Activity: Content Inventory

PROJECT GROUP

Review your chosen open source/SFU community project and start to create a content inventory to estimate considered priority per placement

Content  
Type  
Size
Location  
_Indicated Priority_

---

# Prototyping Using a HTML Framework

* Generate smartphone, tablet, and desktop mockups
* Single source of content for all device presentations
* Supports a fast, highly iterative, design-feedback loop
* Focus first on creating the right thing, then focus on right look
* May be possible to seamlessly move from prototype to website
* Use a Responsive HTML Framework for Prototyping

---

# Use a Responsive HTML Framework for Prototyping

* Twitter Bootstrap
* Zurb Foundation
* Material Design Lite (Google)

---

# Twitter Bootstrap HTML Examples

Two Column Grid

```
<div class="row">
  <div class="span9">...</div>
  <div class="span3">...</div>
</div>
```

Information Alert Box

```
<div class="alert alert-info"> ... </div>
```
